Create vpc with cidr 10.0.0.0/16

webtier -- create 2 public subnet. one in us-east-1a, one in us-east-1b
apptier -- create 2 private subnet. one in us-east-1a, one in us-east-1b
database tier --create 2 private subnet. one in us-east-1a, one in us-east-1b

create internet gateway and attach it to vpc
create application load balancer

create nat gateway in each publicsubnet and attach elastic ip

create auto scaling group with launch template for instance


create route table, subnet association, routes.


traffic comes to internetgateway --> application load balancer --> auto scalinggroup --> publicsubnet

create application load balancer and auto scaling group with lauch template again for privatesubnet apptier.

traffic for private subnet instance should get traffic only from nat gateway.


databasetier: create rds mysql db with multi az enabled.
db receives trafficonly from apptier instance
